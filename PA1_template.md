# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

```r
#Header code, setup required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
```
## Loading and preprocessing the data

```r
unzip(zipfile="activity.zip")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```r
#Here we calculate the sum of steps per day
total.steps <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
qplot(total.steps, binwidth=1000, xlab="total number of steps taken each day")
```

```r
#Now we calculate the average of the daily steps
mean(total.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```

```
## [1] 9354.23
```

```r
median(total.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```

```
## [1] 10395
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```r
library(ggplot2)
#Now we plot the average daily activity by 5-minute interval
averages <- aggregate(x=list(steps=data$steps), by=list(interval=data$interval),
                      FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
ggplot(data=averages, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) +
    geom_line() +
    xlab("5-minute interval") +
    ylab("average number of steps taken")
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png) 

the 5-minute interval contains the maximum number of steps after considering the average of steps in all the days.

```r
averages[which.max(averages$steps),]
```

```
##     interval    steps
## 104      835 206.1698
```

## Inputing missing values

missing values (represented as `NA`) are present corresponding to many days/intervals. missing values can negatively affect the summary stats. so its important to isolate the records with missing attributes.


```r
missing <- is.na(data$steps)
# How many missing
table(missing)
```

```
## missing
## FALSE  TRUE 
## 15264  2304
```

The missing values are filled in with mean value for the 5-minute interval.


```r
# Replace each missing value with the mean value of its 5-minute interval
fill.value <- function(steps, interval) {
    filled <- NA
    if (!is.na(steps))
        filled <- c(steps)
    else
        filled <- (averages[averages$interval==interval, "steps"])
    return(filled)
}
filled.data <- data
# missing values replaced by mean values
filled.data$steps <- mapply(fill.value, filled.data$steps, filled.data$interval)
```
Now, using the filled data set, we make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate the mean and median total number of steps.


```r
total.steps <- tapply(filled.data$steps, filled.data$date, FUN=sum)
qplot(total.steps, binwidth=1000, xlab="total number of steps taken each day")
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png) 

```r
mean(total.steps)
```

```
## [1] 10766.19
```

```r
median(total.steps)
```

```
## [1] 10766.19
```

Mean and median values are larger after adding missing data. The reason is
that in the original data, there are some days with `steps` values `NA` for 
any `interval`. The total number of steps taken in such days are set to 0s by
default. However, after replacing missing `steps` values with the mean `steps`
of associated `interval` value, these 0 values are removed from the histogram
of total number of steps taken each day.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
First, let's find the day of the week for each measurement in the dataset.


```r
weekday.or.weekend <- function(date) {
    day <- weekdays(date)
    if (day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"))
        return("weekday")
    else if (day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"))
        return("weekend")
    else
        stop("invalid date")
}
filled.data$date <- as.Date(filled.data$date)
filled.data$day <- sapply(filled.data$date, FUN=weekday.or.weekend)
```

Now, we show the comparative facets containing plots of average number of steps taken
on weekdays and weekends.

```r
averages <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + day, data=filled.data, mean)
ggplot(averages, aes(interval, steps)) + geom_line() + facet_grid(day ~ .) +
    xlab("5-minute interval") + ylab("Number of steps")
```

We clearly see that over the week end consistently more steps taken as naturally there is more time to move around , whereas over weekdays there is a sudden spike of steps and then it drops.
